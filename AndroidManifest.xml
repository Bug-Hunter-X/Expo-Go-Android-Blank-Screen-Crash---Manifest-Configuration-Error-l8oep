This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the AndroidManifest.xml file's configuration and the Expo Go app's capabilities or when building a standalone app.  It often manifests as a blank screen or a crash immediately after launch.

Example (Illustrative):

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

    <application
        ... >
        <!-- Missing required activity or intent filter -->
    </application>
</manifest>
```
